Hello Everyone,
This repository comes along with the development of a embedded platform for the provisioning of intelligent systems, a Deustotech research in the Smart-Mobility group.
The project was fully carried out by me, Unai Urgoiti Lopez de Luzuriaga, as my final project grade.

All the Files provided are original. They are distributed according their nature.
This repository includes the code used in the Jetson Nano, The Raspberry Pi 4 and the RPI Pico, along with the fabrication designs of the PCB and the 3D models and assemblies for the components.

I hope anyone reading this likes the project and if any question arises feel free to ask or send me an email at unai.urgoiti@opendeusto.es
